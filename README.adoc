= Seedwing Proxy

The _Seedwing Proxy_ is a stateless proxy that sits between a build pipeline and any upstream repository contributing to the build.

By applying a build-specific policy, the _Seedwing Proxy_ will allow or disallow access to the upstream artifacts based upon signatures in `Sigstore`, and possibly `In-Toto` in the future.

== Configuration

Despite its name, this is not a web/http proxy in the conventional
sense. It behaves as a local registry, _proxying_ requests for
software artifacts to an actual repository and returning them only if
they match a given policy.

=== Cargo

In `.cargo/config`:

```
[source.seedwing]
registry = "http://localhost:8181/crates-io/"

[source.crates-io]
replace-with = "seedwing"

```

===  Maven

In `settings.xml`:

```
<settings>

  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>seedwing</id>
      <name>Seedwing "Proxy" Repository</name>
      <url>http://0.0.0.0:8181/m2/</url>
      <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf> <!-- This is important -->
    </mirror>
  </mirrors>
  ...
</settings>

```
