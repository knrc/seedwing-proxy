# Seedwing Proxy

The _Seedwing Proxy_ is a stateless proxy that sits between a build pipeline and any upstream repository contributing to the build.

By applying a build-specific policy, the _Seedwing Proxy_ will allow or disallow access to the upstream artifacts based upon signatures in `Sigstore`, and possibly `In-Toto` in the future.
